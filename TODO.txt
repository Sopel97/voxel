- Proper block updating when adjacent chunk is placed
- Map should handle placing/removing events to adjacent blocks (when placing single blocks. When a chunk is placed, other chunks get notified and resolve updates by themselves)

- Light (after updating is resolved completely)
-- 4 bits for 'sun', 4 bits for local
-- stored and updated in chunk like opacity cache is stored now (so 6 bytes per block)
-- if memory is a problem store 18x18 of actual light values and then gather when needed

- sometimes when generating geometry for drawing bad_alloc is thrown (happens after some exploring, probably due to horrible memory fragmentation), look for a way to minimize memory allocation and preallocate as much as possible.
